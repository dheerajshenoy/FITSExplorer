# DFITS

* A modern FITS image viewer written using CFITSIO library.

## Libraries Used

* CFITSIO
* QT (for GUI)

# TODO

- [x] Display Image: The viewer should be able to load and display FITS images, including support for both single and multi-dimensional images.

- [x] Zoom and Pan: Users should be able to zoom in and out of the image and pan across different parts of the image to explore details.

- [ ] Image Stretching: It should support different types of image stretching methods, such as linear, logarithmic, and histogram equalization, to enhance the visibility of faint details or adjust contrast.

- [ ] Colormap Selection: Users should be able to select different color maps (e.g., grayscale, inverted grayscale, heatmaps) to visualize the image data with various color representations.

- [ ] Region of Interest (ROI): Allow users to define regions of interest (ROIs) within the image for analysis, such as measuring intensity profiles or extracting statistics.

- [ ] Overlay and Annotation: Enable overlaying additional graphics, markers, or annotations on the image for visual analysis and interpretation.

- [ ] Metadata Display: Provide access to FITS header metadata to view essential information about the image, including keywords like object name, exposure time, and instrument settings.

- [ ] Histogram and Statistics: Display histograms of pixel values and provide basic statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) of the image data to analyze its distribution.

- [ ] Image Comparison: Support the ability to open and compare multiple FITS images simultaneously for qualitative and quantitative analysis.

- [ ] Export and Saving: Allow users to export images to various formats (e.g., FITS, PNG, JPEG) and save any modifications made during analysis.

- [ ] Cross-platform Compatibility: Ensure compatibility with multiple operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux) to reach a broader audience of users.

- [ ] Performance Optimization: Optimize rendering performance for handling large, high-resolution images efficiently, ensuring smooth interaction and responsiveness.

- [ ] Customization and Extensions: Provide options for customization and extension through plugins or scripting interfaces, allowing users to tailor the viewer to their specific needs.
